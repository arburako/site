                        <h1>Stress Free Parking</h1>
                        <p>Having a car is a privilege. Yes, a responsibility too, but a privilege first and foremost. Too many times you hear people complaining about what a burden it is to own a car. There are many stressful elements to owning a car including insurance and registration and, of course parking and (ugh) the dreaded parking ticket. At the same time, there too many empty driveways, unused parking spaces and vacant lots out there. Shouldn’t someone help spread the love?  </p>
                        <p> Enter ParkPlease, a peer-to-peer marketplace that alleviates the stress surrounding parking. People with empty parking spaces can use the service to post their spots and people who need parking can rent those spots. You’d be surprised that there are actually very few services who have had success in this arena. So when an old co-worker approached me in June 2012 and asked me to help out the team with the product, I was more than happy to get involved. <font color=red> I’ve been working with the ParkPlease team for the past couple months to create the product spec and get the website off the ground for a Beta launch for the Outside Lands Music Festival in August 2012.</font></p>
                        <p> The overall goal of ParkPlease is simply to de-stress parking. The challenges with the service are that parking is inherently stressful given that one’s automobile is likely her most expensive a valued possession. What else is up there on the list of expensive and valued possessions? One’s property. Therein lies the challenge of the experience surrounding the ParkPlease product: to create a worry-free, fun experience even when dealing with the things people tend to worry about most. So how can you accomplish this goal with interaction design? <b>Make it accessible. Make it social. Make it fun.</b></p>

                        <p>When we first started the project, the primary goal was time to market. Services like Uber and TaxiMagic were growing fast and we wanted to get in the game. We already had a scheduled reservations app, so the strategy was to focus all product development efforts on the On Demand product. We would build out the On Demand side of the app, skin the scheduled app look and feel to be consistent with the new app and learn and iterate from there. The first design featured equal entry to On Demand and Scheduled with a landing screen that asked the user to choose when they wanted to ride. From there, the user was funneled down either the new On Demand flow or the existing reservations flow. We decided on this flow to equalize the balance between Scheduled and On Demand - so that no matter what the user came to the app for, they would not be confused. </p>
                        <p> We then began tackling the brand new user experience problems that were unique to the On Demand experience. For example, we wanted to only present the user with ride times that were available for their location to avoid a "bait and switch". </p>
                     </div>
                     <div class="col-md-6 text-col">
                        <p>How would we know what drivers were available around the customer? We decided when the customer opened the app, we would check for available drive times of the closest driver, assuming current location was the pick up and set expectations accordingly. Whenever the customer moved the map, the time options for the new location would change and the customer would be notified via an slot-machine-like animation on the time and location form fields. </p>
                        <p>Another novel user experience problem that came with the new On Demand service was how to convey pricing to the customer. In the scheduled reservations product, we had always used the pick up and drop off location as inputs to determine the pricing. But in the On Demand offering, we did not want to have to ask the user for a destination and incumber the ordering process. To solve this problem, we created “the rate card”, that featured the flat rates to nearby airports (the most common type of ride) and an interactive, fun way for the user to get a feel for the pricing structure that re-used the development logic from end ride pricing. </p>

                       <p>As soon as we had a solid handle on the product requirements for the On Demand side, we turned to the scheduled reservations app to begin unifying the app.  As I analyzed the existing scheduled flow, I began to think it was based on some system assumptions that were not translating into a truly useable user experience. I presented a detailed analysis of our current flow including suggestions for modifications on existing screens to improve the user experience. I then presented three options for how we could proceed on the scheduled app ranging from barely alter the flow to completely re-do the flow as if we had no time-to-market requirement.  </p>   
                       <p> After discussing as team what the app might look like if we left time-to-market out of the equation, we realized that our original strategy had been wrong. </p>

                       <p>We decided to re-think the app as one flow taking the emphasis off leveraging existing functionality and moving towards thinking like the user, not the system. </p> 
                       <p> Again, I presented three flows to the team ranging from slight departure from the existing On Demand spec and scheduled reservations live app to largest departure. As a team, we decided to go with the flow that was the largest departure from the existing requirements in the name of a better user experience and it was the right decision. Sometimes, you have to recognize that you’ve gone down the wrong path and re-adjust, even if it means you may have to throw out some work. </p>

                        <p>At last, we had a flow that we could all be proud of. It has a balanced entry into On Demand or Scheduled, without asking the user to determine in which category they belong. The first screen asks what is likely to be on the user's mind - when and where do you want to be picked up? The On Demand user can move forward without ever interacting with the date or address controls. However, if the user is looking to schedule for the future, they can easily change the pickup location, date and time, by tapping on the fields.</p>

                        <p>The flow is cohesive and unified. It sets expectations elegantly by using a progress bar on the button as you move through the flow. The interactions on the scheduled screens match those for on demand, so the user feels like they are getting the same experience even though it is different on the back end.</p>

                <p>On Demand is currently still in development at Limos.com. I left the company shortly after the final flow went into development. I wish the project the most success and can't wait to see the outcome. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> The main lesson I took away from this project was never to prioritize shipping something over shipping the right thing. I believe our emphasis on time to market in at the start of the project, really blinded us from seeing that the right thing to do was to create a holistic experience, rather than to tack On Demand onto our existing functionality. Had we taken a holistic approach from the start, we may have saved some time. However, I was lucky to have been working with a team that was so resilient once we realized what the right path was and know the on Demand app will turn out to be a great product.</p>
