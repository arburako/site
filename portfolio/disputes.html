                        <h3> About the Project </h3>
                        <p>Disputes was a feature that provided admins with the functionality to address customer and operator complaints regarding payment. The lack of functionality had been a burden on the Customer Care team for some time and there was a unique window of opportunity on the development front to tackle some of the features needed. The main emphasis on the project was a speedy solution. The Customer Care agents needed something to help resolve disputes and they needed it fast. In order to do that, I had to first identify the problem, then determine the range of solutions and finally derive the strategy.</p>

                        <h3> My Role </h3>
                        <p> As Product Manager, it was my goal to devise a strategy that would solve the needs of the Customer Care agents, avoid the technical complexities and get the tool in the hands of the agents as quickly as possible. Through user research and technical scoping, I formed this product strategy to solve the major pain points surrounding payment disputes for the Customer Care Representatives as quickly as possible.</p>

                     <p class="size-13">  As the first step in identifying the problem, I created a timeline of the key events in the reservation payment cycle. The ride was booked, it was serviced, the operator closed out the ride for the actual charges, the customer was charged and finally, the operator was paid. I labeled the phases in between these key events with numbers to frame the discussion. For each of the phases, I identified which statuses the reservation could take, what functionalities exist for payment adjustments and status changes, and what email communications occur.</p>

                     <p class="size-13"> I then worked with Senior Customer Care Agents to generate a list of the most common use cases and in what phases of the payment cycle they occurred. I analyzed each of the use cases to derive a list of feature priorities.</p>

                     <p class="size-13">  Next, I went back to the Reservation Payment Timeline to find the holes in the current functionality. I found that admins already had sufficient functionality for adjusting payments before customer charge. What we needed was a <i>pause payment</i> functionality and the ability to issue refunds and debits after payment.</p>

                     <h3> Understanding Limitations </h3>
                     <p class="size-13"> The next step was to understand the technical complexities surrounding payment adjustments and derive the most technically simple solution. After a discussion with the engineers, I found that adjusting payments in State #6 was most complex, however, it was essential to the feature priorities. So I asked, how can we make it less complex? We determined that (1) keeping the customer refund equal to the Operator debit and (2) not supporting charging the customer more would reduce a significant amount of complexity with adjusting payments in state 6.</p>

                     <p class="size-13"> Then, as the last step of understanding the context, I went back to the Customer Care use cases to be sure the most use cases would be solved even with the technical limitations that customer refund must equal operator debit and customer cannot be charged more after they have already been charged.</p>

                        <p> The strategy was: </p>
                        <p>(1) Leverage existing functionality. As displayed in the Overall Flow document, agents would have two different flows for ending the dispute based on the state of the reservation; it’s not ideal, but it saved us a lot of time on development, so it was a necessary compromise.</p>

                        <p>(2) Create process flows. Because the feature made compromises for time, I wanted to make sure the SVP of Customer Care and the Customer Care agents were all comfortable with the work flows before development began.</p>
                        <p>(3) Focus on main priorities - ability to freeze payment cycle once a dispute was identified and issuing refunds and debits after the payment had occurred. The Dispute Forms show how this we focused the feature development only on these priorities. </p>

In my first few weeks at Dinamundo, I continued to work with the team at Limos.com to devise a strategy for disputes moving forward. The Customer Care agents were thrilled with the additional functionality.</p>
