          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>In January of 2012, Charlie Ansanelli, a past colleague approached me with an idea to build a parking app that allowed individuals to capitalize on their unused parking spots by renting them out to city residents and visitors in need of parking. After a brief conversation, we agreed that San Francisco's Outside Lands Music Festival would be a great launch setting for the product. Problem was - the festival was in just 8 weeks. I wasn't sure if it was possible to plan, design, code, add supply, market and successfully launch this product in just 8 weeks. But I was game to try. And so was my technical genius co-founder from Dinamundo, Ed Park. ParkPlease now had the right team and the right opportunity. Only one question remained - could we do it?  </p>

                <h2>The Lay of the Land</h2>
                <p>As a first step, I conducted a brief competitive analysis of players in the space; documenting key product flows, supply inventory and brand positioning. I compiled screen comps from any parking marketplace that I could find to understand the breadth of possible features and determine our product positioning strategy. My analysis revealed 2 key insights.</p>

                <h3>No Dominant Player</h3>
                <p>The “airbnb for parking spaces” model had sprouted a handful of upstarts, without much success. Most who started in this model had graduated to the commercial parking, using garage inventory to scale supply more quickly. Many doubted whether enough P2P supply actually existed in the areas of demand, often concentrated in dense urban clusters where there may be an "unwillingness" to share coveted spots. We had to ask ourselves - was it the supply that was insufficient or the previous attempts to tap into it?</p>

                <h3>Focus = Critical</h3>
                <p>The wide variety of possible use cases to support in the domain could make your head spin. The more use cases a product tried to solve for, the more pivots the service took, the harder it was to understand and the more users it lost. With all the potential variables, focus was key. On the opposite spectrum, we were intrigued by the success we saw with services like TaskRabbit and Airbnb taking a high local approach to launch, focusing first on niche markets where the chicken-and-egg problem is more easily overcome and then finding ways to hop from that niche to other niches and eventually to the broader market. </p>
