                  <p class="interstitial"> There’s a prevailing sense that people are too wedded to the flow of information coming at them through their smart phones. Everyone talks about unplugging but very few people are able to follow through. Our phones are intimate parts of our lives now, like it or not. So instead of asking people to unplug in order to focus on real life conversation and connection, why not find a way to use smartphones to enable and enhance real world connections?  </p>
                  <p> <strong> mission:</strong> Use smartphones to encourage real world connections </p>
                  <p> <strong> strategy: </strong> Deliver fun and engagement when people connect </p>

              <h1>The Principles</h1>
              <p class="interstitial"> The iPhone app is straightforward – Players scan QR codes on each other’s phones and are rewarded with a laugh as they read to each other from fortune cookies. The can share out the fortunes and meetings on Facebook, and can keep track of the people they have meet up with from within the app.  </p>
              <p class="interstitial"> This is pretty lightweight stuff. But underneath it are some pretty powerful principles that we believe will drive adoption.  </p>

                  <h3>Connection</h3>
                  <p>People like a good laugh. Scanning a QR code to unlock an amusing fortune cookie message isn’t splitting the atom, but it’s the kind of thing that millions of people do every day by habit when they check their horoscopes, glance through their favorite comedy sites, or check in on the reliably amusing posters in their Twitter feed.</p>

                  <h3> Social Broadcasting </h3>
                  <p>Telling your Facebook community who you are with a powerful social broadcasting tool. Dinamundo is about checking in to people, not places, which makes it easy to use “public displays of connection” to reinforce or initiate real world friendships.  </p>

                  <h3> Scrapbook </h3>
                  <p>People like to keep a diary or scrapbook of where they’ve been and whom they’ve been hanging out with. That’s been a primary driver of geo-local check in adoption, and we think it will be a primary driver of people-centered check ins as well. </p>

                  <h3> Leaderboards </h3>
                  <p>Finally, we are including leaderboards for the more competitive among us, so that people will get the satisfaction of passing their friends as they scan with more people. </p>

              <h1> The Strategy </h1>
              <p class="interstitial"> We expect that most people will use the app with their friends at first. The earliest adopters will hear about the app through social media, blogs, or other media, and download out of curiosity. Someone might have read one of the funny fortune cookie messages that have been re-tweeted from the @dinamundo Twitter account, for example. Or might have read a Facebook posting from someone connected to The Dinamundo Project at one or two degrees of separation. Or might have read a blog post tied to the launch announcement.  </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-8 col8">
              <p>Because the very nature of the app requires that two players engage with it simultaneously while meeting up face to face, some of those early adopters will ask or convince their real-life friends or colleagues or acquaintances to download the app as well. </p> They will get a laugh out of the fortune cookie messages, share the messages and experience to their Facebook friends from within the app, and potentially convince other friends, colleagues and acquaintances to play as well. <p>

              <p class="interstitial"> We are starting small and are hopeful that some of our early adopters start to use Dinamundo on a regular basis, both to get a laugh and to broadcast the people they are hanging out with.</p>
              <p> Over time we think regular users will use the app as an icebreaker in social situations. It’s not difficult to imagine someone approaching a stranger in a bar with a request that they play the game to unlock a funny fortune, or because they could use the help in getting ahead of their pals on the leaderboard. </p>

               <p> As a community of players develops in given markets, we hope to see robustly populated “Players Near Me” sections in the Activity tab, allowing players to meet up with other players in nearby locations, to unlock a fortune cookie and gain on the leaderboard. Unlike most geo-local check-in or proximity-based apps, which rely on users’ courage to approach total strangers for no particular reason, Dinamundo presents players with an easy lightweight icebreaker that should make connecting virtually stress-free. </p>

              <h1> Technical </h1>
              <p  class="interstitial"> We decided to use QR codes to execute the meet ups after evaluating approaches including Bluetooth, “bumping” phones together (EG: Bump), automatic proximity tracking (EG: Highlight, Glancee, Ban.jo), and variations on facial or bio-metric recognition. We realize it’s not the right long term technical solution, but it’s simple, effective, and easy to understand. </p>
              <p> Every player’s QR code is unique, and carries information relating only to that player. The code is generated at the time of sign-up, and lives in an attractive design based on one of the four elements – air, water, earth, sky.The QR code scanner is built into the app. Using Dinamundo doesn’t require a separate scanner app.  </p>

              <p> If someone attempts to use a separate scanner app to scan a Dinamundo-generated QR code, they will be directed to the Dinamundo page in the App Store or to Dinamundo on the web. Dinamundo works on IOS only, on the iOS 4 and iOS 5 operating systems. It requires a network connection, either 3G or WiFi. Dinamundo is not a background app and therefore does not drain the phone’s battery scanning for nearby players. We do a single check as the app is loaded and use that to populate the “players near me” section of the Activity tab. </p>

              <p class="interstitial"> Dinamundo is a free app. Over time we believe a sufficiently large user base may be interested in buying virtual goods for use within the app. But to start off with we are most interested in helping people use their smartphones to connect in real life. </p>

              <p> Over time The Dinamundo Project will make money by doing custom versions of the app for events, conferences and other gatherings where organizers or sponsors are interested in providing attendees with a fun and lightweight way to connect. By customizing the fortune cookie messages and design of the QR codes, the Dinamundo team can provide a nicely customized version quickly and easily. We believe the customer for customized versions to be either the conference organizers, the event planning companies, or sponsoring brands  </p>
