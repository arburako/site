                  <h2> About the Project </h2>
                  <p>The Dinamundo iPhone app is based on a simple yet powerful principle - to use smartphones to enable and enhance our personal connections. Our phones are intimate parts of lives, like it or not. Instead of letting them constantly distract us from the world around us, we can use them to engage with our surroundings at a deeper level. That's the core concept behind Dinamundo, a travel check in game that uses popular gaming strategies to bring people together in the real world and help them create a meaningful connection. </p>

                  <p>The project took place from January 2012 through May 2012. Under the direction of Founder and CEO, startup veteran <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/eblach">Erik Blachford</a>, I led all facets of the product development lifecycle - strategy, interaction + visual design, execution process, etc - from concept ideation through product launch. </p>
