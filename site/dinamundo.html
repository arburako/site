                     <p>Dinamundo is an iPhone app that uses mobile technology to connect people through fun, light-weight moments. The brainchild of Founder and CEO, Erik Blachford, Dinamundo's core mission was to use smartphones to encourage real-world connections, beginning with the traveler to local dynamic. The challenge was to build a light-weight game that would incentize these groups to meet in person for the ostensible purposes of advancement in the game. Once together, the players use the app to check in together - checking in to people, not places - and the app delivers fun and engagement through interpersonal connection. </p>

                        <p> Dinamundo started back in 2011 with the mission of using modern technology to enhance and facilitate meaningful interactions in the real world, rather than distracting us from them. Founder Erik Blachford (formed Expedia CEO), knew his way around the travel space and saw an opportunity to crack the traveler/local meet up nut with using the mechanics of a check in game to incentivize people to meet in person. I first heard of the app in October 2011 from a friend and colleague, Ed Park, had been peripherally involved. When Ed first told me the product, I was immediately enthralled with </p>

                        <p>the idea of checking into people. But the first version had been released as a Facebook app and, while the concepts were there, the experience was a bit clunky. As Ed walked me through the app, we began to imagine what it might look like as a mobile experience.  Bursting with ideas, I went home that night and couldn't help myself from drawing up a few wireframes. I sent them over to Ed and, to my surprise, he had coded the wireframes into a functional prototype the next day! </p>

                         <p> We continued going back and forth for a bit and by Thanksgiving we had nearly a fully functioning app! We knew we had to show Erik even though it was somewhat of a nerve-wracking thought for me. Our prototype was awesome, but maybe a bit too awesome. He didn't even know my name as we had taken his concept and run with it - <i>really</i> run with it. Our intentions were noble and our execution laudable, but I still wasn’t sure how he would react. Ultimately, Erik was thrilled with the prototype. He was impressed with the both the creativity of the app and the inniative of the team.  </p>

                        <p>But most of all, the prototype reminded Erik of two things: (1) the truly exciting, vast potential of his vision and (2) just how much can be accomplished with the right team at the right time. Unbeknownst to us at the time, our prototype had breathed life back into the project when it needed it most. Instead of winding down the Dinamundo Project due to lack of resources, Erik decided to fund the full-scale development of Dinamundo and to hire me and my collegue to run the startup team that would build it.</p>

It had helped him see just how much potential there as to the concept and he had realized that, with the right team and resources behind it, it deserved a real shot. Rather than jump right in to building the prototype though, he wanted to make sure our decisions were founded in solid research.

By basing our design and functionality on these four principles, we believed we had a winning strategy for the app. </p>
