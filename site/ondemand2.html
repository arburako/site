                <h3> About the Project </h3>
                <p>Limos.com is an online and mobile marketplace for limousine and chauffeured cars with a robust car service reservation system and network of over 2,000 Operators. The company had initially focused on the corporate market, offering only “scheduled” service where a reservation must be booked at least an hour in advance. In June 2011, the company saw potential for launching a bigger service that would allow anyone to request and receive car service within the same hour.  This new product offering was called the On Demand app. The whole endeavor included a customer facing iPhone app, an Operator facing Android app, an API integration with a partnering service, as well as multiple site and admin features to support the service. My team was tasked with creating the customer experience and supporting technology from start to finish. </p>

                <h3> My Role </h3>
                <p> As Product Manager, I was responsible for coordinating all the moving parts of for this brand new product offering (mentioned above). I was also the user experience designer for the app creating all flows and wireframes across numerous platforms (iPhone, android, admin web, consumer web). Last, I managed the development cycle for each component, translating my designs into detailed development requirements, working closely with engineers to resolve technical hurdles and systematically communicating with business stakeholders.</p>

Our task was to create a new iPhone app that integrated the existing flow for scheduling reservations and our newly created On Demand functionality into one Limos.com app. The main emphasis for the project was on the On Demand side of the app as the company had recently spent time and resources optimizing their existing scheduled flow. The overarching goal for the On Demand iPhone app was to create a simple, easy,</p>

However, our plan was to roll out the On Demand functionality market by market, so the app had to seamlessly support the following use cases.  </p>

                    <p>Our initial strategy for On Demand development was to focus all efforts on the new On Demand side of the app and leave the existing Scheduled Reservations side as untouched as possible. This meant we would focus on solving for the “real time” and “near term” use cases - the On Demand use cases - as completely separate from the “scheduled” use case, which already had an existing app. Prior to launch we would skin the Scheduled app look and feel to be consistent with the new app. Though it wouldn’t be perfect, it would be live. We could learn and iterate from there. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Based on this strategy, the initial designs featured equal entry to On Demand and Scheduled Reservations with a landing screen that asked the user to choose when they wanted to ride. From there, the user was funneled down either the new On Demand flow or the existing reservations flow. </P>

                      <li>
                        <p>It allowed us to isolate out the “near term” and “real time” use cases - the On Demand use cases - from the “scheduled” use cases, seemingly simplifying the overall body of work to address as well as freeing the On Demand design and development from the existing constraints and limitations of the “scheduled” use case. </p>

                    <h3> Finding Rides </h3>
                    <p> The primary use case that On Demand would cater to was the “pick me up right here, right now” scenario. In order to best serve that user, we wanted the app to display the first available pick up time and nearby drivers based on the user’s current location upon screen load. This would mean displaying cars on the map and the first available ride time at screen load, prior to any user inputs - a flow for which there was no prior system precedence.</p>
                    <p class="top-40"> A secondary use cases came from one of our main product differentiators with our On Demand app. There were already a few services that providing rides for the “right-here-right-now” or “real-time” customer. But we believed that users would greatly benefit from being able to select 15, 20, 30 minutes - the “near-term” customer. Instead of being immediately paired with the nearest driver, the user could, for instance, request a car for when they arrive home in 30 minutes. We believed this was a powerful product differentiator but it also further complicated the already complex interaction of the first screen. For the “near term” user, the available drivers displayed on screen load (based on current time and location) was at best irrelevant and at worst, a bait and switch. </p>

                    <h3> Rethinking Rates </h3>
                    <p> Another differentiator of the On Demand app was our pricing system. Most services at the time had a formula based rate system, much like taxis. However, we wanted our provide our users with the comfort of 0 variability in pricing - meaning that going from point A to point B would be the same rate every time regardless of situational influences on time and distance. This means the user can sit back and relax during the ride, without having to worry about what route the driver is taking or how much traffic there is at the time. </p>
                    <p> We wanted to communicate this benefit to the user in an elegant way and also set expectations up front for how much a ride would cost. In order to calculate any given rate, however, the system needed a pickup and drop off location. But given given that the primary design principle for the On Demand users was fewest possible clicks, we wanted to avoid asking the user to enter a destination.  So how could we communicate pricing up front without needlessly encumbering the ordering process? </p>

We decided to re-think the app as one flow taking the emphasis off leveraging existing functionality and moving towards thinking like the user, not the system. </p>  
                    <br>
                    <p class="top-40 text-center lead"> I presented three flows to the team ranging from slight departure from the existing On Demand spec and scheduled reservations live app to largest departure. As a team, we decided to go with the flow that was the largest departure from the existing requirements in the name of a better user experience and it was the right decision. Sometimes, you have to recognize that you’ve gone down the wrong path and re-adjust, even if it means you may have to throw out some work.  </p>

If the user selects a time and date that is more than an hour out, they are sent down the “Scheduled” path which asks for a few more inputs than the On Demand path. For the longer “Scheduled” path, the app sets expectations elegantly by using a progress bar on the button as you move through the flow. </p>

                <p>On Demand is currently still in development at Limos.com. I left the company shortly after the final flow went into development. I wish the project the most success and can't wait to see the outcome. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> The main lesson I took away from this project was never to prioritize shipping something over shipping the right thing. I believe our emphasis on time to market in at the start of the project, really blinded us from seeing that the right thing to do was to create a holistic experience, rather than to tack On Demand onto our existing functionality. Had we taken a holistic approach from the start, we may have saved some time. However, I was lucky to have been working with a team that was so resilient once we realized what the right path was and know the on Demand app will turn out to be a great product.</p>
