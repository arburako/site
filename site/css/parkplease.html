                  <p>ParkPlease is an online event parking service that makes parking as easy as using a friend's parking space. Anyone with a space can rent it for cash and drivers can easily reserve and enjoy the prime parking locations. In the summer of 2012, I co-founded ParkPlease with 3 others and we proceeded to operate for the following 2 years. </p>

                        <p> If you're driving to a busy area I'd bet there's at least one thing on your mind - parking. Will you be able to get a spot close to your destination? Will there be parking meters? Are there any lots nearby? Which ones have the best price?  The last thing you want is to end up circling the neighborhood, tearing your hair out and yelling at pigeons, entirely flustered by the ordeal of finding a spot. </p>
                        <p> And the worrying doesn't end with finding a spot. If you've parked at a meter, you're a slave to the timer at the risk of an expensive ticket. If you've found street parking, you wonder if your car is safe or if you interpreted the sign correctly.  </p>

                        <p> Bottom line: parking is stressful. Spots are hard to find, posted rules read like complex riddles, and miscalculations are costly. Its stressful from the minute you start to plan your trip until the minute you return home.   People want to plan ahead for parking. In an age where you can reserve you car, your room, your table, your seats, and even your outfit ahead of time your parking spot should be no different. So why are we putting up with all this nonsense?  </p>

The challenges with the service are that parking is inherently stressful given that one’s automobile is likely her most expensive a valued possession. What else is up there on the list of expensive and valued possessions? One’s property. Therein lies the challenge of the experience surrounding the ParkPlease product: to create a worry-free, fun experience even when dealing with the things people tend to worry about most. So how can you accomplish this goal with interaction design? <b><font size = 4> Make it accessible. Make it social. Make it fun. </font></b></p>

The filters help narrow the spots further and the spots turn grey after they have been viewed so the user knows what they have already clicked on. The flows for posting a spot and for booking a spot were designed with the goal of being completely transparent to the user about what to expect. The pages for posting a spot show exactly the steps that the user will go through as they post their spot front and center, so the user knows where he is in the process at each step of the way. The flow for booking a spot explains to the user how the requests work at the header of each screen. </p>

Because of this belief, I have envisioned a very interactive seller dashboard with hints of game mechanics, to excite and motivate sellers to continue to post spots and confirm their reservations. Sellers can see all the activity that has occurred on their spots in their dashboard to help them understand why their spot may or may not be booking and also to give them the tools to reach out to people who seem interested in their spots.

The large “upcoming payments” number reflects the total amount pending for confirmed reservations (sellers do not get paid until after the reservation is complete). Each time a seller confirms a reservation, the number will go up. The positive reinforcement will motivate sellers to confirm reservations and the pot of gold at the end of the line will encourage sellers to carry out the agreement with integrity.</p>

                     <p class="text-white-trans"> The main lesson I took away from this project was never to prioritize shipping something over shipping the right thing. I believe our emphasis on time to market in at the start of the project, really blinded us from seeing that the right thing to do was to create a holistic experience, rather than to tack On Demand onto our existing functionality. Had we taken a holistic approach from the start, we may have saved some time. However, I was lucky to have been working with a team that was so resilient once we realized what the right path was and know the on Demand app will turn out to be a great product.</p>
