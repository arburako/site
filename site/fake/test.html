                <h3> About the Project </h3>
                <p>ParkPlease is an online event parking service that makes parking as easy as using a friend's parking space. Anyone with a space can rent it for cash and drivers can easily reserve and enjoy the prime parking locations. In the summer of 2012, I joined with three others to create the founding team of ParkPlease. In just 8 weeks, we created and launched our beta service for the Outside Lands Music Festival in San Francisco, making city and regional headlines and helping over 180,000 concert goers find stress free parking. </p>

                <h3> My Role </h3>
                <p> As Co-Founder and Head of Product, I managed the product roadmap, led the design process, oversaw the development and kept everyone running in the same direction in a fast paced environment. I also created the website flows, interactions and layouts from the ground up, and became responsible for the visual design and user operations after launch. </p>

                        <p class="top-80"> If you're driving to a busy area I'd bet there's at least one thing on your mind - parking. Will you be able to get a spot close to your destination? Will there be parking meters? Are there any lots nearby? Which ones have the best price? The last thing you want is to end up circling the neighborhood, tearing your hair out and yelling at pigeons, entirely flustered by the ordeal of finding a spot.And the worrying doesn't end with finding a spot. If you've parked at a meter, you're a slave to the timer at the risk of an expensive ticket. If you've found street parking, you wonder if your car is safe or if you interpreted the sign correctly. And I'm sure we've all experienced that moment of shock of and awe when leaving a lot - you want how much for two hours?! </p>
                        <p>Bottom line: parking is stressful. Spots are hard to find, posted rules read like complex riddles, and miscalculations are costly. Its stressful from the minute you start to plan your trip until the minute you return home. People want to plan ahead for parking. In an age where you can reserve you car, your room, your table, your seats, and even your outfit ahead of time your parking spot should be no different. So why are we putting up with all this nonsense? Bottom line: parking is stressful. Spots are hard to find, posted rules read like complex riddles, and miscalculations are costly.
